# Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit
The Medical Imaging Segmentation Toolkit (MIST) is a simple, fully automated 3D medical imaging 
segmentation framework for PyTorch and TensorFlow. MIST allows researchers to quickly set up, train, 
and test various deep learning models for 3D medical imaging segmentation.

For documentation on how to run either the PyTorch or TensorFlow implementations, please see the 
following
